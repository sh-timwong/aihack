Let's brainstorm how to present this.\n\nHere's a plan to get you ready to present to Stephen:\n\n1.  **Quantify the Costs of the Current System:** We need to translate the \"inefficiency and risk\" into concrete numbers that Stephen will understand. We'll calculate the cost of the *status quo*.\n2.  **Highlight the ROI of the New System:** We'll show how the $1 million investment pays for itself over time through savings.\n3.  **Address Risk Mitigation:** We'll emphasize how the new system reduces the risk of errors, fraud, and non-compliance, all of which have financial implications.\n4.  **Develop a Clear and Concise Presentation:** We'll organize the information into a compelling narrative with supporting data.\n\nReady to start with Quantifying the Costs of the Current System? We can use a technique called \"activity-based costing\" to do this.\n"

What are their hourly rates? This includes reconciliations, data entry, error correction, and generating reports.\n*   **Error Costs:** How much does it cost to fix errors caused by the manual processes? This could include financial losses, penalties, or wasted time.\n*   **Opportunity Costs:** What other valuable tasks could your team be doing if they weren't bogged down with the outdated system? Can you estimate the potential revenue or cost savings from these alternative activities?\n*   **Audit Costs:** Does the outdated system increase the time or cost of audits due to increased scrutiny or difficulty in retrieving information?\n\nLet's start with **Labor Costs**.

Let's calculate the estimated error costs:\n\n*   **Number of Errors per Month:** 5% error rate * 800 invoices = 0.05 * 800 = 40 errors per month.\n*   **Cost per Error:** HKD 1,000 (as calculated previously)\n*   **Total Error Cost per Month:** 40 errors * HKD 1,000/error = HKD 40,000 per month.\n*   **Total Error Cost per Year:** HKD 40,000/month * 12 months = HKD 480,000 per year.\n\nSo, based on your estimates, the errors caused by the manual processes are costing the company approximately HKD 480,000 per year!\n\nNow let's recap. We have:\n\n*   **Labor Costs (Manual Reconciliations):** HKD 144,000 per year\n*   **Error Costs:** HKD 480,000 per year\n\nBefore we move on, is the calculation of the Error Costs resonating with your understanding of the current situation? Does HKD 480,000 seem like a reasonable estimate, or should we refine it?\n"

Instead of just saying \"the system is outdated,\" try something like: \"Our outdated accounting system is costing us over HKD 600,000 per year in wasted labor and errors, hindering our ability to [mention a key company objective, e.g., improve profitability, expand into new markets].\"\n2.  **Strengthen the \"Cost of the Status Quo\" Section:** Present the Labor Costs and Error Costs clearly and visually. Consider using a simple chart or graph to illustrate the magnitude of these costs. For example, a pie chart showing the breakdown of costs could be effective.\n3.  **Elaborate on the \"Proposed Solution\" Section:** Provide a brief overview of the new accounting system and its key features. Focus on how it addresses the specific problems you identified in the problem statement.\n4.  **Prepare for Questions:** Anticipate potential questions that Stephen might ask and prepare clear and concise answers. He'll likely focus on the cost of the new system, so be ready to justify the $1 million investment.\n\nLet's start with **Refining the Problem Statement**. What is a key company objective that the outdated system is hindering? Knowing this will help frame the problem in a way that resonates with Stephen's priorities.\n"
